Flame Install:

Set the DL_PYTHON_HOOK_PATH environment variable to the [NIM_CONNECTOR_ROOT]/plugins/Flame/python location

DL_PYTHON_HOOK_PATH

Allows you to set the path to the Python hooks files. It behaves similar to other PATH variables.

export DL_PYTHON_HOOK_PATH=/share1/dev/python_hooks/test:/share1/dev/python_hooks/production

In the above example, Flame loads the hooks from test first, and then for any undefined hooks, continue to scan production.



OSX:
	Edit the setenv.DL_PYTHON_HOOK_PATH.plist file and replace [NIM_CONNECTOR_ROOT] with the full path to the NIM Connector root folder.

	Copy the file to: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/setenv.DL_PYTHON_HOOK_PATH.plist

	Reboot
